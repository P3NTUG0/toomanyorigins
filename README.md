# TooManyOrigins
Made by Pug, Omniv and Pepsi

This is the GitHub repository for the TooManyOrigins addon for the Origins mod. You are able to read the source code for the project here as well as have a cup of coffee for your troubles of coming here.

If you have found a bug or you just want to suggest a feature you are able to do so [here](https://github.com/MerchantPug/toomanyorigins/issues).

If you'd like to use TooManyOrigins' powers in a datapack you can read up on the [Wiki](https://github.com/MerchantPug/toomanyorigins/wiki).
It's recommended to have some knowledge on Origins datapacks before doing so.
